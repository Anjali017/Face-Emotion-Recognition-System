## Project Overview

The Face Emotion Detection System using Intel oneAPI is an innovative project that leverages the power of Intel's oneAPI toolkit to develop an intelligent and real-time emotion detection system. This system aims to accurately analyze and classify facial expressions to determine the underlying emotions of individuals in images or video streams. By combining the capabilities of deep learning, computer vision, and Intel's hardware acceleration, this project will create a robust and efficient solution for emotion analysis.

## Features:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing.
- Model Selection
- Model Training
- Real-time Emotion Detection
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Deployment

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (recommended: Python 3.x)
- Libaries (TensorFlow, Keras, Tqdm, Numpy, Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook (for data preprocessing)
- VS Code (for algorithm implementation) 
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge (for web development)

## Usage

By completing this project, you'll not only develop a functional emotion detection system but also gain valuable experience in utilizing Intel's oneAPI toolkit for optimizing deep learning models and creating high-performance applications. This system could find applications in areas like market research, user experience evaluation, mental health support, and more.

## Project Structure

- `images/`: Store image files of emotions(happy,sad etc).
- `static/`: Contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web application.
- `trainmodel/`: Jupyter notebook file for data preprocessing and algorithm implementation.
- `app.py/`: The main python application file.
- `requirements.txt/`: Lists the required Python packages.

## Data Sources

For the dataset we are using the face emotion recognition dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset
